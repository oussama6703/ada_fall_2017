## Abstract
The idea of our project is to give a clear insight into the trends in research around the world, and shed the light on the latest technologies by analyzing a dataset of patents relative to these technologies. We shall give statistics by country and company of the number of granted patents, and analyze their evolution over time aiming to extract meaningful informations relative to the growth of a technology/industry.

Patent application give an accurate idea on the evolution of high-end sectors such as Energy, Financial Technology (FinTech), Artificial Intelligence. The core of our project will be to study these 3 different sectors in order to understand their evolution in the past and predict their growth in the future.

## Research questions

What is the general trend in research (patent application)? Is it growing?    	
Which sectors have grown the most over time? (e.g: IT, Energy, Medical, Consumers goods, etc.) In which regions? 
Which countries deliver more patents? Is this correlated with the quality of their universities?
Out of all the patent applications, how many of them are actually granted?
In the future, what will be the evolution of the chosen sectors?

Energy: 
Is the research in Energy in the US increasing/decreasing? 
Did Trump election or COOP21 influence the research in the Energy sector (less patents delivered after any political decision? Which green energy sector is the most popular currently and how did it evolve in the past (wind, solar, geothermal, energy storage …)? 
Which country is more involved in that energy sector research? 
What is the proportion of patent applications in the fossil energy compared to the green energy and how did it evolve over time?

FinTech: 
How did financial technology grow over the past decade? 
How important is the use of mobile e-banking apps over the globe? 
Which countries are involved the most in FinTech? Which companies hold most of FinTech patents? 
All these questions can be answered by analyzing the patents relative to these technologies and observing their evolution over time.

Artificial Intelligence:
Which are the most cited and used patent within the field of AI?
What is the popularity trend of the AI field? Like in its popularity in 1960s, will the popularity in recent years will also fade away in time or this time characteristic of the popularity trend is different?
Which companies are holding most AI patents? Is there a relationship between number of AI patents hold and the rank (according to Forbes top 500) of a company (meaning that smartest companies are also the the biggest ones)?
Which countries have the most patents related to artificial intelligence?
Considering that Putin recently said “the nation that leads in AI will be the ruler of the world”. What is the relationship between number AI related patents and the rank of countries’ defense industry?

## Dataset
The patent dataset (http://www.patentsview.org) will be used to carry out our research. PatentsView provides a useful API that allows us to make specific research according to a patent title, inventor or locations. For example, we could research how many patents in a specific topic were delivered by IBM in California from 2012 and 2015. It is possible that we will need other informations not contained in the dataset (e.g university ranking) which are useful to find correlations and enrich our dataset. For those specific case, we will scrap those informations from the web. At the end, the API will be used to make more specific research related to each sector of interest (e.g number of patents in solar panel vs. number of wind turbines design patents).
